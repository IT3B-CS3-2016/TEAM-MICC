"Health Care Checker"

        In this system the nurse and the doctor of a hospital will be using it, when a nurse is doing his/her daily rounds for each patient
assign to them he/she will just record  it in the said  system that will  be  directly recorded and can be seen by the doctor  to check and 
update about the patients condition. The data will be in graph format  for a easier check of  the patients update when the doctor  looks at
it. And recording the data will be quicker as the inputing of the gathered data is been compiled quicker for a easier way of view.
The doctor click a specific patient and can see the update of that patient in the day so if ever the doctor have some recommendations or
other advice for the help on the patients recovering.
